gemspec

# Declare your gem's dependencies in locomotive-search.gemspec.
# Bundler will treat runtime dependencies like base dependencies, and
# development dependencies will be added by default to the :development group.
# gem 'locomotive_cms', github: 'locomotivecms/engine' # FIXME: make the tests pass before LocomotiveCMS v2.5.x is out
# gem 'activesearch', github: 'Papipo/activesearch'

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.
